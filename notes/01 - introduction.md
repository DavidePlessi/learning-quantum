# How is quantum computing different?
Quantum computing builds on weird quantum behavior.The idea of a bit is different: A quantum bit is not just OFF or ON, it can be in superposition.
Bits are not independent of each other, they can be entangled.

## Quantum computing architecture
There is a Foundamental difference in the way we program QCs, it is not based on the Von Neumann architecture. Von Neuman architecture is the idea that theire is a CPU which perform computations on data stored in memory.  
CPU + Memory model doesn't apply to quantum computers.  
Quantum computers are designed like a digital circuit with gates, instead of bits, the gates operate on quantum bits (**Qubits**).  
The qubits are not independent they can be superposed and entangled with each other, superposition and entanglement requires us to rethink algorithms in a fundamental way. Programming quantum computers involves Math.
